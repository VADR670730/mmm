  Event Table
=====================================

This module is a custom add-on to ``event``
It allows defining a set of table associated to an event.
All tables are numbered with a unique number but can also have a specific name "ex: VIP Table"
A Table can only host attendees to the event up to a max number.
Please note that no check is done on the fact that an event attendee is registered to more than one table.
